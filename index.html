      Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
      The best move I've recently watched is actually a film series called Star Wars: Andor (Referred as Andor). The story took place in the Star Wars Universe before the destruction of the first Death Star, a moon-size battle station capable of destroying an entire planet. The story follows the main character, Cassian Andor, on his journey from being a thief on his home planet Ferrix, to getting spiralled into a large-scale conspiracy across the galaxy.

      Synopsis
    </h1>
    <p>
      At the beginning, Andor accidentally killed two patrol officers on Ferrix forcing him to escape the planet. On his way out, he met Luthen who is planning a heist against an Imperial vault and promised to reward him handsomely afterwards. As the heist concluded, he found himself being tracked down by Imperial agents as they suspect a link of him towards a larger Rebellion uprising, while being hunted by Luthen wanting to remove traces of his activity by killing people working for himself.

      Analysis & Comment
    </h1>
    <p>
      Although the ending of this series hasn't been released, critics rated it highly due to its cinematic storytelling, focus on details, and writing that gave the Star Wars franchise a fresh perspective. Instead of having close-quarter-combats of iconic characters to delivery fan service, Andor focuses on the more on-the-ground perspective talking about the smaller things happening behind the scene; the politics within the Imperial intelligence agency, the struggles of the people organizing the rebellion, and the everyday life of the ordinary people bearing the consequences of war. These are all the things the major Star Wars films didn't show us, which added realism and allowed viewers to better understand how the world inside Star Wars actually work. If you're to simply compare the major films to Andor, the movies are the huge stage-light moment, and Andor is the little things happening behind how the battle got to how it is.
